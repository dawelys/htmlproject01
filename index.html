        <h1 style="color:royalblue">Try this if you dare!</h1>
        <p style="color:white"> Come in children and we shall test your courage. You may THINK you are not easily scared but that is because you haven't tried one of our many scary houses. Beware of your health because I can guarantee that your heart will try to jump out of your chest multiple times. DO NOT PLAY WITH MY BABIES or they will bite and that will ruin all the fun.</p>

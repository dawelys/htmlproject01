        <p id= "demo" style="color:white"> There is a story behind each and every one of our house. One of our main attractions is 'The house of death. Built in the 1850s the house is rumored to be haunted by no less than 22 spirits which vary from children to psychopatic adults. The former owner, Mark Twain, still roams the basement dressed in his favorite white suit waiting for the next victim to arrive.  </p>
